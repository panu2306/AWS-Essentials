## Amazon Cognito 
Amazon cognito provides authentication, authorisation and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple. 

There two main components of Amazon Cognito: 
- User Pools
- Identity Pools

#### User Pools: 
This component is used for authenticating(sign-up & sign-in) webapps or mobile apps. Cognito stores user data such as username & password. Also, cognito can authenticate using third party accounts(also known as federated identities) such as Facebook, Google etc. 

#### Identity Pools: 
This component is used for accessing the other AWS services. Users can obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
